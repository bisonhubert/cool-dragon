# Game of Thrones Deadpool Leaderboard

## About

Cool Dragon is a retro-inspired, mobile-responsive leaderboard and an automated scoring program for an in-office Game of Thrones Deadpool game. As a huge fan of the show and looking for ways to savor its final season, I invited friends and family to play with a modified deadpool sheet I found online. After realizing that the scoring complexity was both time consuming and easy to err, I decided to turn it into a program. An ouline on how to play lives [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGUmgt2rweh8s5ZZ_C7CvPB2R6t8R6Licc002579kJk/edit).
